<p>Application and front end developer with experience working in light research roles with cutting edge technology. Experience making prototypes and support software (content creation, localisation, previewing tools etc.) for the end product applications that I create. Wide experience and training in different technologies and languages. Keen advocate of automation and documentation. I take pride in the fact my code is readable and conforms to best practices and industry standard approaches, however I love to learn from others and so am not afraid of code reviews!</p>
